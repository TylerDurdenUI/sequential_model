We are excited to announce a new initiative to strengthen collaboration between our data science and engineering teams. Starting next week, we will be holding weekly half-hour meetings, aimed at facilitating open dialogue, addressing data-related issues, and sharing knowledge on various topics.

Meeting Details:

Goal: Improve collaboration between data scientists and engineers
Format: 30-minute Q&A discussion
Frequency: Weekly
During each meeting, all data scientists and engineers are encouraged to participate in discussions, ask questions, and share insights. Topics can range from ad-hoc data issues and general technologies to platforms, access, and more. The aim is to create an environment that fosters open communication and enhances our collective understanding.

If no questions are raised during the group discussion, we will move to separate meeting rooms for more focused, one-on-one data conversations. If no questions arise in this setting either, feel free to drop from the meeting.

We believe these weekly meetings will help bridge any gaps between our teams, leading to a more efficient and cohesive working relationship. A calendar invite with the specific time and virtual meeting link will be sent out shortly. We look forward to your active participation in this new initiative.

Let's work together to make these meetings engaging, informative, and productive for everyone involved.

Best regards,
